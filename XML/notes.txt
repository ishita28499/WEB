The XML above is quite self-descriptive:
----------------------------------------
>>> It has sender information.
>>> It has receiver information
>>> It has a heading
>>> It has a message body.

The difference b/w XML and HTML
-------------------------------
XML and HTML were defined with different goals

>>> XML was designed to carry data - with focus 
    HTML was designed to display the data

>>> XML doesn't have any predefined tags
>>> HTML use prefined tags


XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags
--------------------------------
>>> The XML language has no predefined tags
>>> The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. 
    These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.
>>> HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.
>>> With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.  


XML is Extensible
-----------------
>>> Most XML applications will work as expected even if new data is added (or removed).
>>> Imagine an application designed to display the original version of note.xml (<to> <from> <heading> <body>).
>>> Then imagine a newer version of note.xml with added <date> and <hour> elements, and a removed <heading>.
>>> The way XML is constructed, older version of the application can still work



Why Study XML
-------------
>>> XML plays an important role in many different IT systems
>>> XML is often used for distributing data over the Internet.
>>> It is important (for all types of software developers!) to have a good understanding of XML.


XML Tree Structure
------------------
>>> XML documents are formed as element trees.
>>> An XML tree starts at a root element and branches from the root to child elements.
>>> All elements can have sub elements (child elements):

<root>
  <child>
    <subchild>.....</subchild>
  </child>
</root>



XML Syntax Rules
----------------
>>> XML Documents Must Have a Root Element

<root>
  <child>
    <subchild>.....</subchild>
  </child>
</root>


>>> XML Tags are Case Sensitive
>>> XML Elements Must be Properly Nested
    <b><i>This text is bold and italic</b></i>
>>> XML Attribute Values Must Always be Quoted

What is an XML Element?
-----------------------
>>> An XML element is everything from (including) the element's start tag to (including) the element's end tag.
    <price>29.99</price>

An element can contain:
--> text
--> attributes
--> other elements
--> or a mix of the above 

<bookstore>
  <book category="children">
    <title>Harry Potter</title>
    <author>J K. Rowling</author>
    <year>2005</year>
    <price>29.99</price>
  </book>
  <book category="web">
    <title>Learning XML</title>
    <author>Erik T. Ray</author>
    <year>2003</year>
    <price>39.95</price>
  </book>
</bookstore>

<title>, <author>, <year>, and <price> have text content because they contain text (like 29.99).
<bookstore> and <book> have element contents, because they contain elements.
<book> has an attribute (category="children").

Empty XML Elements
------------------
--> An element with no content is said to be empty.
--> In XML, you can indicate an empty element like this:
<element></element>



XML Naming Rules    
----------------
XML elements must follow these naming rules:
--------------------------------------------
>>> Element names are case-sensitive
>>> Element names must start with a letter or underscore
>>> Element names cannot start with the letters xml (or XML, or Xml, etc)
>>> Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods
>>> Element names cannot contain spaces
>>> Any name can be used, no words are reserved (except xml)

XML Attributes
--------------
>>> XML elements can have attributes, just like HTML
>>> Attributes are designed to contain data related to a specific element.

XML Attributes Must be Quoted
-----------------------------
<person gender="female">


XML Elements vs. Attributes
---------------------------
<person gender="female">
  <firstname>Anna</firstname>
  <lastname>Smith</lastname>
</person>

>> gender is attribute
>> firstname is element
